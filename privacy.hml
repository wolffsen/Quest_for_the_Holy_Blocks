  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 7, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Quest for the Holy Blocks</strong> is a casual mobile puzzle game developed by <strong>Spikey Norman</strong>.
    The game is designed for offline play and does not require registration, sign-in, or an internet connection to function.
    This Privacy Policy explains what limited information may be collected when you use the app and how that information is handled.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect, store, or share your name, email, address, location, or any personally identifiable data.</li>
    <li>Track your gameplay across devices.</li>
    <li>Use analytics, crash reporting, or cloud-sync services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All gameplay data (scores, preferences, daily-challenge progress, and power-ups) is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>.</p>

  <h2>3. Advertising and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Quest for the Holy Blocks displays ads provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may automatically collect certain non-identifiable device and usage data
    (for example, advertising ID, approximate location, or device type) in order to deliver, limit, and measure ads.
  </p>
  <p>These ads may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Interstitial ads</strong> shown between games</li>
    <li><strong>Rewarded ads</strong> that grant in-game power-ups after watching</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    AdMob’s use of data is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. User Consent (GDPR / EEA Users)</h2>
  <p>
    If you are located in the European Economic Area or other regions that require consent, the game uses Google’s
    <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> to request permission to show personalized or non-personalized ads.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can change your ad-consent choice at any time through the in-game Settings → Privacy menu.</li>
    <li>If you decline personalized ads, you will still see contextual (non-personalized) ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Quest for the Holy Blocks is suitable for general audiences but is <strong>not directed toward children under 13 years of age</strong>
    (or the applicable local age of digital consent). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All gameplay data is stored locally on your device. AdMob data is handled by Google LLC in accordance with its security and privacy standards.
    We do not transmit any game data to our own servers.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may disable internet access to the game at any time; offline play remains fully functional (ads will simply not load).</li>
    <li>You can reset your advertising ID in your device settings to limit ad tracking.</li>
    <li>You can uninstall the app at any time, which deletes all locally stored data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
    Any future version will be available at the same web address and will include the date of last modification at the top of the page.
  </p>
